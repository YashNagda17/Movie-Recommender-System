# Movie-Recommender-System

In this Project, a Movie recommender system is built based on TMDB-Small dataset. 
<br /> Using the links file of the dataset, and the TMDB API, additional data for each movie is fetched from TMDB Database. The updated dataset is uploaded.

 <br /> The ML Part is divided into 2 files:
 <br /> 1.The Notebook 'Jupyter-Notebook' contains pre-processing and Performance of dataset on few basic models.
 <br /> 2.The Notebook 'Main_Model' contains the implementation of final main model, used to give accurate recommendations and for implementation.

<br /> The django folder consists of backend implementation, and movie_frontend consists of frontend made by react. 

<br /> To start backend, run the following command: python manage.py runserver

<br /> Once backend is active, run the frontend by running the following command: npm start
